Notka Online Clipboard
=====================

Notka is kind of online storage for text. In Polish it means 'short text message'.
You can open your notka in browser from any internet connected device
and use/edit/save your text.

In technology terms this is

        - small http server serving http/javascript content
          with React (https://facebook.github.io/react)

        - C++ backend server written with Qt

        - MySql database

So far so good - it runs.

Try it
======

There is a plan to keep continuous, online Notka service running
which is unstable currently, though if you are lucky enough,
you will be able to try it online at www.notka.online
(experimental until I compile Qt server on no-graphics amazon box).
Please login as a default user with following credentials:

        - user: "user"
        - password: "password"

Save text, reload page or open from different place and have your notka back.
If nothing happens after you tried to login - it's dynamic/static IP issue
and I would appreciate if you let me know about it ;p
