Notka Online Clipboard
=====================

Notka is kind of online storage for text. In Polish it means 'short text message'.
You can open your notka in browser from any internet connected device
and use/edit/save your text.

In technology terms this is

        - small http server serving http/javascript content
          with React (https://facebook.github.io/react)

        - C++ backend server written in Qt/MySql


Try it

There is a plan to keep continuous, online Notka service running.
So far it is in alpha version but if you are lucky enough,
you may be able to try it online at www.notka.online.
Please login as a default user with following credentials:

        - user: "user"
        - password: "password"

Save text, reload page or open from different place and have your notka back.
